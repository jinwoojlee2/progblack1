    <h1>With the help of computer-based algorithms and databases, healthcare providers can match a patient's genetic profile to the most effective treatments, medications, and therapies. This approach maximises treatment efficacy while minimising potential side effects.</h1>
    
    <h2>Genomic Sequencing and Data Analysis</h2>
    <p>Genomic sequencing is the process of determining the complete DNA sequence of an individual's genome. This is made possible through high-throughput DNA sequencing machines.</p>
    
    <h3>Data Analysis</h3>
    <p>Data analysis plays a crucial role in making sense of genomic data:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Data Preprocessing: Ensuring data accuracy and quality by removing errors and artifacts.</li>
        <li>Alignment and Mapping: Comparing an individual's DNA to a reference genome to identify genetic variations.</li>
        <li>Variant Calling: Identifying and characterizing genetic variations using computer algorithms.</li>
        <li>Data Interpretation: Understanding the significance of genetic differences in relation to diseases and traits.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Treatment Customization</h2>
    <p>Once genomic data is analyzed, personalized medicine can provide tailored treatment recommendations:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Clinical Decision Support Systems: Computer-based systems use the analyzed genomic data and other medical information to recommend treatments.</li>
        <li>Tailored Therapies: Treatments are customized to an individual's genetic profile for maximum effectiveness and minimum side effects.</li>
        <li>Early Disease Detection: Identifying genetic markers for early detection and prevention of diseases.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Personalized medicine is revolutionizing healthcare by leveraging computer science and genomics to provide patient-specific treatments.</p>
