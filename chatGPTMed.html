    <h1>Treatment Customisation and Personalised Medicine</h1>
    
    <p>With the help of computer-based algorithms and databases, healthcare providers can match a patient's genetic profile to the most effective treatments, medications, and therapies. This approach maximises treatment efficacy while minimising potential side effects.</p>
    
    <h2>Genomic Data Collection</h2>

    <h3>Genomic Sequencing</h3>
    <p>Genomic sequencing is the process of determining the complete DNA sequence of an individual's genome. These machines can process billions of DNA base pairs, which make up an individual's genetic code, in a relatively short amount of time.</p>

    <h3>Data Stroage</h3>
    <p>The vast amount of data generated through genomic sequencing is stored electronically. Each individual's genomic data is a unique digital representation of their genetic information.</p>
        
    <h2>Data Analysis</h2>
    <p>Data analysis plays a crucial role in making sense of genomic data:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Data Preprocessing: Ensuring data accuracy and quality by removing errors and artifacts.</li>
        <li>Alignment and Mapping: Comparing an individual's DNA to a reference genome to identify genetic variations.</li>
        <li>Variant Calling: Identifying and characterizing genetic variations using computer algorithms.</li>
        <li>Data Interpretation: Understanding the significance of genetic differences in relation to diseases and traits.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Treatment Recommendations</h2>
    <p>Once genomic data is analyzed, personalized medicine can provide tailored treatment recommendations:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Clinical Decision Support Systems: Computer-based systems use the analyzed genomic data and other medical information to recommend treatments.</li>
        <li>Tailored Therapies: Treatments are customized to an individual's genetic profile for maximum effectiveness and minimum side effects.</li>
        <li>Early Disease Detection: Identifying genetic markers for early detection and prevention of diseases.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Personalized medicine is revolutionizing healthcare by leveraging computer science and genomics to provide patient-specific treatments.</p>
